# 🧠 Cosine Similarity Heatmap Visualizer in Google Colab

A sleek Google Colab notebook to **analyze and visualize cosine similarity** between multiple text documents using a heatmap. Built for NLP enthusiasts, data scientists, and learners who want to **explore semantic similarity** in a visual, intuitive way.

---

## 💡 What is Cosine Similarity?

**Cosine Similarity** is a metric used to measure how similar two documents are, regardless of their size. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.

This tool uses `TF-IDF` to vectorize input texts and `scikit-learn` to compute similarity, then displays the results via a **heatmap** for better understanding.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn` – for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculation  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for plotting beautiful heatmaps  
- `Google Colab` – for execution in a cloud environment  
- `Python` – of course, the glue of it all

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🟢 Step 1: Open in Google Colab  
> Copy the code from the notebook or upload this repo and run it in Google Colab.

### 🔧 Step 2: Install Dependencies

```python
!pip install -q scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
📝 Step 3: Input Your Documents
Edit the documents list with your own text samples:

python
Copy
Edit
documents = [
    "Apple is a fruit.",
    "Apple Inc. is a tech company.",
    ...
]
🔍 Step 4: Run the Notebook
It will:

Compute cosine similarities

Generate a heatmap

Save it as a .png file

Provide a download link to the heatmap image

📊 Output Preview

(Replace the link above with your actual PNG if hosted on GitHub or Colab.)
